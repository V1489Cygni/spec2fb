1. Introduction

The international standart IEC 61499 is a standart for industrial process measurement and control systems.
The specification of IEC 61499 defines a generic model for distributed control systems and is based on the IEC 61131 standart.
An application in IEC 61499 consists of a network of basic function blocks (BFB). Basic function block is described in terms
of an execution control chart (ECC), which is a finite-state machine (FSM) where every state can have several actions.
Each action references one or zero algorithms and one or zero events. Algorithms can be implemented as defined in compliant standarts.

Formal specification is a useful thing to have in a software project. It usually expressed in temporal logics, e.g.
Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Such specifications are often written for finite-state machine models of software.

It is natural for one, having a temporal specification of a function block, to be willing to automatically generate it.
In this paper we propose to solve that problem. The contribution of the paper is an approach based on genetic programming (GP)
for evolving execution control charts for basic function blocks, that satisfy the given specification.

2. Problem Statemanet

In this section we provide a more formal problem statement. We first briefly review the main concepts used in this study.

An ECC is a -tuple $\langle \rangle$, where $E$ is a set of input events, $I$ is a set of input boolean variables,
$Y$ is a set of states, $Z$ is a set of output events, $O$ is a set of output boolean variables, $y_0$ is the initial state,
$\phi : Y \times E \times \{0,1\}^{|I|} \rightarrow Y$ is the transition function, $\sigma : Y \rightarrow Z^*$ is the output
actions function and $\eta : Y \rightarrow \{0,1,x\}^{|O|}$ is the output variables function, where 0 and 1 mean assigning a
corresponding value to a variable and $x$ means preserving its current value.

The LTL language consists of problem dependent propositional variables, Boolean logic operators $\vee, \wedge, \lnot, \rightarrow$
and the following set of temporal operators. Globally - $G(f)$ means that than $f$ has to hold for all states. next - $X(f)$ means
that $f$ has to hold in the next state.
